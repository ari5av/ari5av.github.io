    <p>The backtory of The Tour&trade; is incredible.</p>
    <p>A couple of years ago, we moved my wife's grandma to a semi-assisted living facility, where she still lives.</p>
    <p>She's a hoarder though, and she didn't want to lose any of her stuff.  It's mainly clothes, handbags, shoes, costume jewelry, and some boxes of books nobody really wants.</p>
    <p>We spent four months bagging up the clothes, building clothing racks in my basement, hauling it all over, and hanging it up, where it now remains.</p>
    <p>She had used to be a professional dancer (think Broadway), so a lot of her stuff is kind of outlandish.  A lot of The Tour&trade; has to do with the more ridiculous stuff I've found, but the most impressive part is the sheer quantity that's there.</p>
    <p>Everybody's reaction to seeing my basement for the first time is different.  One person literally broke down sobbing.</p>
    <p>PS: there's a Bonus Round&trade; too.</p>
