      <div class="display-5">Session Reports (latest first):</div>

      <p></p>

      <h3>Session 16:</h3>
      <p>
        The party were surprised to discover that two of their previous companions, Niolas (human F1) and Hogan (dwarf F2) had been out adventuring on their own and were captured and enslaved by the
        very same orc party from the previous session, and were two of the redeemed slaves! Niolas and Hogan joined the party, and everyone got some well-needed rest.<br />
        <b>DAYS 28 THROUGH 30</b><br />
        The party traveled (now afoot leading their remaining mounts) west-northwest along the Suss Road without incident, totaling approximately 60 miles.<br />
        <b>DAY 31</b><br />
        The Suss Road began to gradually turn to the southwest, into the Suss Forest itself. The party made the decision to continue off the road into scrubland to the northwest, staying within sight
        of the coast of the Woolly Bay itself.<br />
        <b>DAY 32</b><br />
        The party encountered a lone fire beetle which was dispatched with ease by several ranged weapons. Niolas harvested its fireglands, which will continue to glow as candlelight through day 35
        but are currently stored in an opaque sack.<br />
        <b>DAY 33</b><br />
        The party continued northwest through the coastal scrubland without incident.<br />
        <b>DAY 34</b><br />
        Before dawn, while Bronan was on watch, a band of 12 goblins came upon the party. Glordir awoke immediately, and he and Bronan began to defend against the horde. During the second round, an
        elf appeared and joined the fray. The remainder of the party joined at the beginning of the fourth round, when most of the goblins were burned to a crisp by Clem's
        <i>burning hands</i> spell.<br />
        After the fight, the elf introduced himself as Killoriol (elf F1) and explained that he had been stalking the goblins for some time and attacked when he saw them attack an unwitting party of
        adventurers. Killoriol joined the party, end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 15:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>END BASIC, BEGIN AD&amp;D</b><br />
        The party made its way out of Cave G and back to the Keep safely, where several new members joined.<br />
        <b>DAY 25</b><br />
        Durin (dwarf F3), Gabbai (human C2), Clem (human M3), Father Tuck (human C1), and faithful friend Bronan (P3) set forth from the Keep in a northeasterly direction toward the Suss Road, along
        with new companions Linus Padfoot (halfling T1), Glordir Woodkin (human R1), Groot (half-elf D1), Kaien (Mk1), and Gorgrim (half-orc F1). The goal was to reach the Free City of Greyhawk by
        taking the Suss Road north along the Wild Coast, then following the Selintan to Greyhawk itself.<br />
        After a few hours, the mounted party encountered several gnolls in the hills. The party gained surprise advantage, but the zealous Gorgrim became the unlucky target of one of the gnolls and
        was killed with one hit when a parley attempt failed. The remainder of the gnolls were dispatched with, and the clerics buried poor Gorgrim at the spot where he died. The party camped nearby
        for the night.<br />
        <b>DAY 26</b><br />
        The day and night passed without incident as the party continued through the foothills of the Drachensgrab Mountains toward the north coast.<br />
        <b>DAY 27</b><br />
        While passing in the valley between two hills, the party encountered a small animal of no description which was immediately pounced upon by a hungry maned lion from a nearby hill. Linus
        spotted the lion, and Groot carefully approached while casting <i>speak with animals</i> to assure the lion that the party meant him no harm and wished only to continue onward. The lion
        withdrew (with his kill), and the party reached the Suss Road, nearby which they pitched camp behind a berm.<br />
        Not long thereafter, Glordir spotted an oncoming party of armed orcs with two mean-looking wolves on leads, escorting four shackled slaves! Durin and Bronan ascended the berm, and Durin called
        out in orcish, indicating a wish to buy the slaves. After a tense encounter where Bronan was nearly slain or taken hostage, the slaves were ransomed for the price of 65gp and two horses, and
        the orcish party reluctantly moved on.<br />
        End session, the freed slaves have been brought into the party's camp, and the campfire has been re-kindled.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 14:</h3>
      <p>
        For once, the luck of the dice was with the party, showing no random encounters on the way back to the Keep, despite a slow pace due to the tied-up bandit prisoners. The prisoners were
        delivered into the hands of the Captain of the Guard and the party rested up<br />
        <b>DAY 25</b><br />
        The Captain of the Watch asked the party to escort several watchmen to the designated outpost site<br />
        Niolas, Hogan, Marius, Drugmir, Durin, Clem, and Bronan set out with the watchmen; no random encounters, so the watchmen stopped off and started building the outpost while the party continued
        to the Caves of Chaos<br />
        The party decided to tackle Cave G at the far end of the valley, which was full of cracked bones and rotting corpses<br />
        It wasn't long before the party discovered that this was the lair of a vicious owlbear, which immediately ripped Marius limb from limb before a pack of seven giant rats joined the fight from
        behind, closing the party in a narrow cavern with seemingly no escape!<br />
        A somewhat useful sleep spell from Clem took out three of the rats, and a poisoned wheel of cheese thrown as bait took out two more, while the owlbear was slowly whittled down<br />
        One last room in Cave G held a pool with three gray oozes, and Hogan shot one with his crossbow several times until it collapsed into sludge, while the other two slid slowly into the water<br />
        End session, party remains in the room with the pool and the remaining two(?) gray oozes...
      </p>

      <h3>Session 13:</h3>
      <p>
        Back at the Keep, the party brought their broken friend Bronan immediately to the chapel for emergency healing by the Curate and his acolytes. In a last-ditch effort to secure divine help for
        Bronan, Clem even emptied his pockets into the donation box.<br />
        The party decided to rest and recuperate for a few days, advancing to...<br />
        <b>DAY 24</b><br />
        Marius, Drugmir, Father Tuck, Gabbai, Niolas, Hogan, Durin, Clem, and Bronan met the Captain of the Watch in the Keep's tavern, upset that he found himself unable to protect law and order on
        the wilderness road<br />
        The party suggested the establishment of a watch outpost on the road, halfway between the Keep and the Caves of Chaos<br />
        The Captain agreed, but such a feat could not be accomplished while the Keep faced the constant threat of raiders and bandits gathering in the woods to the south<br />
        The party therefore headed south into the woods and came across a large clearing with a dozen evil men waiting for nightfall to raid the Keep and steal all of the horses stabled there! They
        dispatched the raiders, killing their captain and capturing their lieutenant and four spearmen to be dealt with by the authorities at the Keep<br />
      </p>

      <h3>Session 12:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>DAY 21</b><br />
        Marius, Drugmir, Durin, Gabbai, Niolas, and Hogan, all having healed up from previous attempts to fight the forces of Chaos, set forth upon their trusty mounts with their friend Bronan and new
        acquaintances, Lareth the Priest and his two silent acolytes, on the east road toward the Caves of Chaos<br />
        Unfortunately, the dice were not in their favor, and before the halfway point the party had encountered no fewer than three random encounters!<br />
        First was several giant oil beetles crossing the road, which were dispatched with ease<br />
        Second was a returning party of battered veteran adventurers, who gave some advice about one of the higher-up caves; it was mazelike and there were inexplicable sounds in the cave, seeming to
        come from all directions<br />
        Third, the party encountered a pair of hungry mountain lions which put up a very strong fight<br />
        Niolas used a flask of oil and torch to set one lion aflame, but the other savagely mauled Bronan before both ran off<br />
        The party asked their friend Lareth to cast cure light wounds on their injured friend, and Lareth realized he was caught, for he was in fact an Evil High Priest all along, and had instead
        prepared CAUSE light wounds! When he cast his spell, drawing negative energy and releasing it into his "patient", Bronan fell to the ground and writhed in agony while Lareth and his acolytes
        attacked the party<br />
        The acolytes were vanquished quickly, but Lareth's magical plate mail and magical shield proved difficult challenges for the party, who were quickly losing resources<br />
        During the fight, Lareth referred to someone he evidently serves, whom he calls "The Dark Lady"<br />
        Another burning flask of oil thrown at Lareth by Niolas was easily batted away, and as fate would have it, it fell directly onto poor Bronan, who now was at death's door and still on fire!
        Niolas quickly kicked dirt over him and smothered the flames with his own cloak<br />
        As the fire all around licked at the Evil High Priest's armor, he withdrew a scroll and read from it; before the final word of the spell, he announced to the party, "You haven't seen the last
        of me!" At the spell's climax, a loud bang was heard and a large cloud of smoke filled the area - when the smoke cleared, Lareth was gone!<br />
        End session, the party has returned to the Keep in much worse shape than previously thought<br />
        Gabbai advanced to level 2, and Durin advanced to level 3<br />
      </p>

      <h3>Session 11:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>DAY 20</b><br />
        Marius, Drugmir, Durin, Clem, and Robert met the jovial priest, Lareth, who collected his two silent acolytes and joined the party (with Bronan, as usual) in their pursuit of the Chaotic
        forces in the Caves of Chaos<br />
        Upon going to the chapel in the Keep to receive a blessing from the Curate, Durin privately learned that the Curate doesn't trust Lareth<br />
        The party were plagued by random encounters on the road, however - a gray ooze which nearly killed Marius, as well as several ghouls that used their paralyzing touch to kill Robert and nearly
        destroy the entire party until Lareth's acolytes were able to take care of them<br />
        The party decided to return to the Keep as they were in no condition to fight just at the moment, and then encountered a robber fly and ANOTHER gray ooze, which were both quickly skipped
        past<br />
        End session, party has returned to the Keep, broken and bruised
      </p>

      <h3>Session 10:</h3>
      <p>
        We retcon to fast-forward to...<br />
        <b>DAY 19</b><br />
        ...where Grol, Durin, a newly resurrected Clem, and Robert (T) approach the Caves of Chaos<br />
        Party explores cave E, a one-room cave with an ogre<br />
        After dealing many heavy blows to the ogre (including Clem's attempt at distraction, though the ogre was unfazed), it retreated deeper into the cave<br />
        Party attempted to smoke him out, but he disappeared through a secret revolving wall into the goblin caves where he sounded the alarm<br />
        The party looted the ogre's treasure, discovering several magical items and a lot of currency, though it was quickly determined that some of it was counterfeit<br />
        Party discovered that goblins are very squishy indeed, and the ogre surrendered and agreed to join the party as a mercenary fighter for the price of 20 gold pieces, paid out of his own stash
        of counterfeit coins<br />
        Party leaves the caves to fight another day, and on the way back to the keep encountered a stagecoach of nobles heading north along the road (flying the banner of the large town of Elredd),
        who were willing to trade a halfling-sized suit of leather armor +1 for 325 gp<br />
        After this transaction and the stagecoach left northward, the party discovered the dagger wound covered in dried blood on the suit of armor's back (dun dun DUNNNNN)<br />
        End session, party approaches the Keep
      </p>

      <h3>Session 9:</h3>
      <p>
        Grol had escorted the remaining kobolds out of the cave and presumably made it back to the Keep safely, while Hogan joined the party, having ridden up to the Caves of Chaos alone<br />
        Exploring the rest of the kobold cave, the party discovered three kobold guards making a last stand who were promptly dealt with<br />
        In the chieftain's chamber, the harem ran away when presented with the chieftain's severed head, and the party looted the remainder of the cave<br />
        <b>DAY 7</b><br />
        After an uneventful trip back to the Keep to drop off loot and heal some minor wounds, the party started back to the Keep<br />
        Party encountered some robber flies but rode past them after one bit Elmer, Durin's mule<br />
        Party also encountered another adventuring party returning from the Caves, who presented them with true information about the multiple orc clans and the fact that the higher elevation the
        entrance to the cave, the more dangerous the cave probably is<br />
        End session, party intends to start exploring cave D
      </p>

      <h3>Session 8:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>DAY 6</b><br />
        Durin (D2), Grol (C2), Gabbai (C1), and Marius (T3) left the Keep with Bronan on an expedition to the Caves of Chaos<br />
        After an encounter on the road with a gnoll, costing the party the life of one of the horses, they arrived at the kobold cave<br />
        Encountered 13 giant rats left from the last adventure in this cave - burned five to death, and the remaining 8 attacked at the mouth of the cave<br />
        Two giant rats were killed, including the leader, and the rest scattered out into the valley<br />
        The noise attracted the attention of most of the kobolds in the common area, who approached curiously<br />
        A peace offering with the kobold chieftain failed, and a battle ensued where the kobold chieftain and several of the kobold clan were killed<br />
        The remaining kobolds in the common area begged to be let go, which the party allowed<br />
        End session, party is resting 1 turn in the kobold common area<br />
      </p>

      <h3>Session 7:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>DAY 5</b><br />
        Durin and Clem went adventuring with two new adventurers, Sylp of Vesve Forest (E) and Tyr Anvilborn (D)<br />
        Party ventured north to the location of the treasure on the map, which was guarded by the Mad Hermit and his mountain lion Kitty<br />
        Clem and Tyr were killed, and during the fight Garret Slinko (T) snuck up on the party and joined to try and defeat the Hermit<br />
        Treasure was recovered, including the Hermit's own hidden cache of coins and items<br />
        Clem's body was taken back to the Keep for resurrection

        Encountered a party of bandits on the way out of the marsh<br />
        Durin tricked the bandit captain into drinking poison, and the rest of the bandits ran off leaving a very large pile of stolen treasure behind, including a treasure map<br />
        Clem, Hogan, Durin, and Grol leveled up to 2, and Marius leveled up to 3
      </p>
