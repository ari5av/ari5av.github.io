      <h3>Session 02x03 (6-8-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Following the old crone who called out to them, the party followed back to Mother Screng's Herb Shop, where Mother Screng (secretly <b>Canoness Y'dey</b>, until recently the chief cleric of St. Cuthbert in Hommlet) read a <i>raise dead</i> scroll to bring back Clem from the dead.  Her daughter Hruda was revealed to be <b>Murfles</b>, member of the Gnarley Rangers and former traveling companion of Nulb's blacksmith, secretly <b>Sir Otis</b>, Knight Bachelor of Veluna.  All three are agents of the King of Furyondy, in Nulb on a reconnaissance mission to observe the comings and goings in the nearby Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canoness Y'dey explained some of the cult's history and directed the party to speak to Sir Otis, who advised them to avoid continuing to blow their cover and to blend into Nulb as much as possible before taking on the Temple itself.  The party therefore chose a nearby hovel as a temporary safehouse, removed the squatters using violence, and went to the Boatmen's Tavern in the Nulb Market.  They immediately asked for information about the Temple from <b>Lodriss</b>, the barmaid, who didn't give them much but a sharp tongue and a bill for rent on their hovel, which she apparently owned.  As the local businesses in the market closed, <b>Carson</b> the local fishmonger/rumor broker came in, and for a moderate price he advised the party to watch for bandits and raiders bringing to the Temple goods and captives, indicating that the Temple is flourishing again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party indicated a desire to leave Nulb as quickly as possible to tackle the Temple.  Perhaps some hired men-at-arms would be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clem's soul continues to struggle to reenter his body as he attempts to recover in the home of Mother Screng/Canoness Y'dey; end session.  XP earned: 237, split among Benedict, Fod, Durin, Linus, and Alric.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 02x02 (5-25-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        On the west side of the bridge across the Imeryds Run, the party noticed a few of Nulb's typical shacks and hovels, along with one well-built, sturdy-looking house.  They knocked, but no answer came.  Linus was therefore sent to scout ahead at the Waterside Hostel.  He learned the names of two of the bar wenches (<b>Dala</b> and <b>Pearl</b>), and ordered mead which turned out sour and brackish.  Meanwhile, the party stabled the six horses and Elmer the mule at the smithy at the center of town.  They requested that all seven animals be reshoed, which severely annoyed the smith as night had already fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the hostel, the party joined Linus, who had learned the name of the proprietor (<b>Mr. Rentsch</b>), a hardened and evil-looking fellow with a scarred face and an eyepatch.  They received no indication of local rumor from him, but they did notice Pearl share a glance with the greasy-looking bartender when they asked.  The party engaged two rooms for the night which turned out to be unfurnished except for a pile of old filthy straw and rodent nests.  The rooms' doors were just holey sheets crudely nailed to the top of the doorframe.  Clem almost shared a room with a lady of the evening but ultimately decided against it, and shockingly the party were not robbed blind overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the morning, the party picked up the mounts at the smith's stables, then heard a cut-off scream down the street.  They discovered a man lying in the street who had been stabbed through the chest, piercing his tattoo of an equilateral triangle.  Since no murderer was able to be immediately found, they decided to drag the body to the nearby river, where they discovered the remains of an old river barge run aground years ago, broken in half, with most of its usable timber scavenged.  Clem dragged the body to the remains of what had been the forecastle and set it on fire to give the victim a sort of Viking funeral.  This attracted the attention of the inhabitants of the aft section of the barge, a colony of lizard-men who immediately skewered Clem from behind.

      <p>
        The rest of the party used oil flasks to burn the lizard-men and defeat them, but the barge's remains finally lost structural integrity, broke apart, and began to sink.  Before it was completely lost, they looted part of the barge hold for some treasure.  XP earned: 8435, split among Benedict, Fod, Durin, Linus, and Alric.

        As the party recovered their breath, loaded the treasure and Clem's body onto the mounts, the voice of an old crone called out to them: "If you want your friend to live again, you'll come with me right now!"  End session.

      <h3>Session 02x01 (5-18-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Benedict and Linus, having been welcomed back to Hommlet as the heroes who saved the town from the evil forces in the nearby moathouse, joined in an adventuring party with Durin and Clem, who had come through the Wild Coast from Hardby, and Fod and Alric, who had been sent from Verbobonc.  The new party had heard the call for local heroes from the noble <b>Lord Wilfrick, Viscount of Verbobonc</b>, to report to Hommlet's council for an important follow-up mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having now been given some more background on the fears of a resurgence of the ancient cult of Elemental Evil which seemed to have survived the destruction of the new Temple ten years ago, the party exchanged some funds and stored some treasure with <b>Nira Melubb</b>, Hommlet's most honest citizen (and the local moneychanger), mounted up, and headed with their new regional map along the Low Road toward the base and ramshackle town of Nulb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon turning from the Versofor highway onto the Low Road, the party encountered an assassin and his three magic-casting henchmen who were on their way to Hommlet to meet (and destroy) them.  A four-round battle ensued, and the would-be murderers met their ends without accomplishing their goal.  Upon searching their persons, the party discovered a still-unused clerical scroll of <i>cure light wounds</i>, and a strange black stone scarab engraved with the mysterious rune-letters "TZGY".  XP earned: 1355, split among Benedict, Fod, Clem, Durin, Linus, and Alric.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party continued along the Low Road relatively without event.  Approaching the bridge over the Imeryds Run, the party got their first sight of Nulb, and they recalled hearing about a few of Nulb's notable locations: the Waterside Hostel, the smithy and stable, the herbalist's shop, and the Nulb black market warehouse, containing the Boatmen's Tavern.  From their vantage point, they also saw the wreck of a river barge upstream a few hundred yards, which appeared to have been picked apart by the locals for usable timber.  End session, just before crossing the bridge.
