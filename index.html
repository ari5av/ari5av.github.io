      <h3>Session 02x07 (8-17-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        The party descended down into the depths of the Temple via the main staircase and found themselves in a large stone gallery.  The walls on either side were draped in tapestries showing unspeakable and horrific acts of cruelty and malice.  Four statues of evil creatures stood in a line in the center of the north end of the gallery.  The south end narrowed into an arcade of doorways.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the doors led to a small ablution chamber, with a pool of milky and putrid water.  It was also discovered that a second door led to this same chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turns 1-3 were spent exploring and getting bearings on where the party were.  On turn 4, a pack of bandits acting as <b>Temple guards</b>> appeared around a corner, distrusting and attacking the strange party of people seemingly from different elemental cults, yet working together in a group.  Six were killed, and the remaining six surrendered.  Their weapons were tossed into the pool in the ablution chamber, and the surviving ones were themselves led into the chamber while the door was wedged shut from the outside.  At the end of turn 4, six bandit corpses remain in full view on the ground in the gallery; end session.

      <h3>Session 02x06 (8-10-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        The party proceeded back into the Temple grounds and entered the Temple through its front doors.  Searching around revealed the general layout of the ruined upper works of the Temple, including at least two potential paths down into the labyrinthine depths below: a wide circular well which seemed to have previously had wooden stairs spiraling down, as well as a wide stone stairway leading down past where the shadowy light could reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the apse of the Temple the party discovered a large mosaiced dais with a throne of basalt.  From behind the throne, a creature of negative energy called a drelb appeared and attacked the party, and several party members were touched and collapsed, shivering.  The drelb was fended off, and the party agreed to descend into the depths of the dungeon itself; end session.  XP earned: 46 xp each for Clem, Terri, Alric, Benedict, and Fod.

      <h3>Session 02x05 (7-27-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        A quick trip back to Nulb resulted in finding two dead dwarven cultists on the road, surrounded by a cloud of bats.  After fighting them off and discovering that the dwarves had been on their way to the Temple with an offering of stolen magical chain mail, the party reentered Nulb, only to encounter a group of bandits whose feeble attempt to ambush them was ultimately unsuccessful.

      <h3>Session 02x04 (7-6-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        The party hired two men-at-arms to assist them in scouting out the Temple area.  Heading south along a muddy overgrown track, they soon discovered the location of the <b>Temple of Elemental Evil</b> complex.  To the northeast of the complex was a large area of tents, wattle huts, and hastily built structures, swarming with orcs, many of whom were armed and armored.  The party decided to avoid this <b>orc camp</b> for now
      </p>
      <p>
        The Temple itself appeared intact and frightening-looking, a tall sharp-looking stone cathedral covered in friezes of horrible creatures' evil faces.  It was surrounded by two concentric walls, the inner a lower wall of stone, partially in ruins, and the outermost a taller palisade of logs, patrolled by guards along its top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the western side of the palisade formed a gate between a large ruined guard tower and a newer small wooden structure.  The southern side hosted a stone gatehouse.  The party chose to enter through the eastern gate, where a wagonload of pillaged supplies had just entered.  They followed north into an outdoor training yard and presented the small scarab engraved with TZGY runes (looted from Lareth the Beautiful) to the armorer, who then greeted them as brothers and friends.  After loading up on weapons and ammunition, the party resolved to enter the Temple itself; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 02x03 (6-8-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Following the old crone who called out to them, the party followed back to Mother Screng's Herb Shop, where Mother Screng (secretly <b>Canoness Y'dey</b>, until recently the chief cleric of St. Cuthbert in Hommlet) read a <i>raise dead</i> scroll to bring back Clem from the dead.  Her daughter Hruda was revealed to be <b>Murfles</b>, member of the Gnarley Rangers and former traveling companion of Nulb's blacksmith, secretly <b>Sir Otis</b>, Knight Bachelor of Veluna.  All three are agents of the King of Furyondy, in Nulb on a reconnaissance mission to observe the comings and goings in the nearby Temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canoness Y'dey explained some of the cult's history and directed the party to speak to Sir Otis, who advised them to avoid continuing to blow their cover and to blend into Nulb as much as possible before taking on the Temple itself.  The party therefore chose a nearby hovel as a temporary safehouse, removed the squatters using violence, and went to the Boatmen's Tavern in the Nulb Market.  They immediately asked for information about the Temple from <b>Lodriss</b>, the barmaid, who didn't give them much but a sharp tongue and a bill for rent on their hovel, which she apparently owned.  As the local businesses in the market closed, <b>Carson</b> the local fishmonger/rumor broker came in, and for a moderate price he advised the party to watch for bandits and raiders bringing to the Temple goods and captives, indicating that the Temple is flourishing again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party indicated a desire to leave Nulb as quickly as possible to tackle the Temple.  Perhaps some hired men-at-arms would be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clem's soul continues to struggle to reenter his body as he attempts to recover in the home of Mother Screng/Canoness Y'dey; end session.  XP earned: 237, split among Benedict, Fod, Durin, Linus, and Alric.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 02x02 (5-25-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        On the west side of the bridge across the Imeryds Run, the party noticed a few of Nulb's typical shacks and hovels, along with one well-built, sturdy-looking house.  They knocked, but no answer came.  Linus was therefore sent to scout ahead at the Waterside Hostel.  He learned the names of two of the bar wenches (<b>Dala</b> and <b>Pearl</b>), and ordered mead which turned out sour and brackish.  Meanwhile, the party stabled the six horses and Elmer the mule at the smithy at the center of town.  They requested that all seven animals be reshoed, which severely annoyed the smith as night had already fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the hostel, the party joined Linus, who had learned the name of the proprietor (<b>Mr. Rentsch</b>), a hardened and evil-looking fellow with a scarred face and an eyepatch.  They received no indication of local rumor from him, but they did notice Pearl share a glance with the greasy-looking bartender when they asked.  The party engaged two rooms for the night which turned out to be unfurnished except for a pile of old filthy straw and rodent nests.  The rooms' doors were just holey sheets crudely nailed to the top of the doorframe.  Clem almost shared a room with a lady of the evening but ultimately decided against it, and shockingly the party were not robbed blind overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the morning, the party picked up the mounts at the smith's stables, then heard a cut-off scream down the street.  They discovered a man lying in the street who had been stabbed through the chest, piercing his tattoo of an equilateral triangle.  Since no murderer was able to be immediately found, they decided to drag the body to the nearby river, where they discovered the remains of an old river barge run aground years ago, broken in half, with most of its usable timber scavenged.  Clem dragged the body to the remains of what had been the forecastle and set it on fire to give the victim a sort of Viking funeral.  This attracted the attention of the inhabitants of the aft section of the barge, a colony of lizard-men who immediately skewered Clem from behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the party used oil flasks to burn the lizard-men and defeat them, but the barge's remains finally lost structural integrity, broke apart, and began to sink.  Before it was completely lost, they looted part of the barge hold for some treasure.  XP earned: 8435, split among Benedict, Fod, Durin, Linus, and Alric.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the party recovered their breath, loaded the treasure and Clem's body onto the mounts, the voice of an old crone called out to them: "If you want your friend to live again, you'll come with me right now!"  End session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 02x01 (5-18-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Benedict and Linus, having been welcomed back to Hommlet as the heroes who saved the town from the evil forces in the nearby moathouse, joined in an adventuring party with Durin and Clem, who had come through the Wild Coast from Hardby, and Fod and Alric, who had been sent from Verbobonc.  The new party had heard the call for local heroes from the noble <b>Lord Wilfrick, Viscount of Verbobonc</b>, to report to Hommlet's council for an important follow-up mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having now been given some more background on the fears of a resurgence of the ancient cult of Elemental Evil which seemed to have survived the destruction of the new Temple ten years ago, the party exchanged some funds and stored some treasure with <b>Nira Melubb</b>, Hommlet's most honest citizen (and the local moneychanger), mounted up, and headed with their new regional map along the Low Road toward the base and ramshackle town of Nulb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon turning from the Versofor highway onto the Low Road, the party encountered an assassin and his three magic-casting henchmen who were on their way to Hommlet to meet (and destroy) them.  A four-round battle ensued, and the would-be murderers met their ends without accomplishing their goal.  Upon searching their persons, the party discovered a still-unused clerical scroll of <i>cure light wounds</i>, and a strange black stone scarab engraved with the mysterious rune-letters "TZGY".  XP earned: 1355, split among Benedict, Fod, Clem, Durin, Linus, and Alric.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party continued along the Low Road relatively without event.  Approaching the bridge over the Imeryds Run, the party got their first sight of Nulb, and they recalled hearing about a few of Nulb's notable locations: the Waterside Hostel, the smithy and stable, the herbalist's shop, and the Nulb black market warehouse, containing the Boatmen's Tavern.  From their vantage point, they also saw the wreck of a river barge upstream a few hundred yards, which appeared to have been picked apart by the locals for usable timber.  End session, just before crossing the bridge.
