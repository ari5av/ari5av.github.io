      <h3>Session 01x01 (12-14-2024)</h3>
      <p>
        Created character: Uri.<br />
        Gave players' background from T1 again for those who had missed it, as well as the adventure introduction.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The party rode into the Village of Hommlet from the south and upon being presented with the village map, decided to go straight to the Inn of the Welcome Wench for brunch.  They were greeted by <b>Ostler Gundigoot</b>, the owner and innkeeper, who served them good food and drink.  He explained that he had fought in the <b>Battle of Emridy Meadows</b> ten years prior, alongside his good friend <b>Jaroo Ashstaff</b>, now the Druid of the Grove in central Hommlet.  Ostler told the party that both Jaroo and <b>Canon Terjon, priest of St. Cuthbert,</b> would be good folk to speak to for a religious training, and the traders' establishment at the base of the hill would be a good source for adventuring equipment.  Ostler then had to see to other patrons.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Church of St. Cuthbert, junior priest <b>Calmert</b> showed concern over the rise in bandit activity.  He explained some of the recent history of the region and expressed fear that he, a young priest with no exposure to war, might soon be thrust into the very center of a resurgence of a decades-old war that may not have ended, just paused for the losing side to lick its wounds.  When the party asked how they could help, Calmert summoned his superior, Canon Terjon.  Terjon explained that the Hommlet council was divided as to the very existence of a resurgence, so he asked the party that any evidence of spies or servants of the old evil should be brought to him or to <b>Rufus</b> and <b>Burne</b> at the new wizard's tower in the east part of town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calmert then asked the party to deliver a written message to <b>Larissa</b>, a serving girl at the Inn of the Welcome Wench.  The message was delivered after the party not-so-discreetly read it and discovered that Calmert is deeply in love with Larissa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party next went to visit <b>Rannos Davl</b> at the traders' establishment to buy some adventuring gear, but they caused a disturbance and Rannos' partner <b>Gremag</b> showed them the door.  From the outside, the party discovered that in Rannos and Gremag's private quarters was a heavy metal lockbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next door, the local carter's wife explained that her husband and two hired drivers were away on a crucial delivery to the gnomes in the Kron Hills and would be back by morning.  She revealed that she instinctively didn't quite trust the traders, but had no explanation for why.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party continued back into the center of town; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 01x00 (12-07-2024):</h3>
      <p>
        Created characters: Gregor, Rocco, Benedict, Balin, Freddie, and Bill Bill.<br />
        Gave players' background from T1.
