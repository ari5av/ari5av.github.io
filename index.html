      <h3>Session 01x04 (1-11-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Rocco, Benedict, Balin, and Derek continued in the ruined Moathouse, uncovering the remaining rooms.  They quickly defeated a giant lizard in a partially collapsed chamber before being attacked by a giant tick in a deserted kitchen area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retreating back to Hommlet with Freddie Moonshine's unconscious body, the party met with Jaroo Ashstaff, the Druid of the Grove in the center of town.  Jaroo appreciated the party's foray into the Moathouse, but the simple presence of a group of bandits taking shelter there was not sufficient to show that Elemental Evil was again on the rise.  Without a connection to the old Temple near the village of Nulb a day's travel from Hommlet, <b>Hesta the village elder</b> could not yet be persuaded to act.  The party rested for the evening; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 01x03 (1-4-2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Created characters: Sprinkles Pinefumbler, Derek Thingolfine, Gael.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party cautiously made its way into the courtyard of the Moathouse keep.  They defeated a huge spider in the frontmost tower, then Gael the barbarian rushed up the stairs and through the broken-down doors, into the former Great Hall.  Sprinkles decided to check out the west-leading hallway, while down the south-leading hallway the rest of the party discovered a few mostly destroyed rooms and chambers, one of which housed an enormous constrictor snake.  Sprinkles discovered a couple of mostly empty rooms, but there are a couple more still to be explored in that hallway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the rest of the party opened the door to the northeast tower and unleashed a bloodbath on themselves, as eight bandits and their captain lay hidden waiting to ambush whoever opened the door.  Although the bandits were killed quickly, the captain put up a serious fight.  After a successful attempt by Freddie to charm him, the party continued to attack, causing the plan to capture him alive to completely backfire.  Gregor and Gael were left dead in the room, Freddie unconscious but stable at 0 hit points, and the rest of the party fleeing for their lives down the south-leading hallway.  The party spotted the bandit captain, angry and injured, disappearing into an archway near the west hallway; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 01x02 (12-21-2024):</h3>
      <p>
        Created character: Zilco.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party rode toward the Moathouse east of the village.  Upon approaching the small keep, they dismounted and approached the rotting drawbridge, whereupon they heard the ominous sound of deep croaking.  They were attacked by five giant frogs, only one of which was able to fully approach the party.  The last remaining frog cried out in mourning of its lost brothers with an enormous croak, calling forth a massive giant crocodile from the depths of the moat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rocco was attacked and partially swallowed by the giant frog, but was rescued by his new adventuring mates who killed it quickly.  Then attention was directed toward the giant crocodile, a much more dangerous threat.  Balin was attacked with a vicious bite attack and knocked unconscious from blood loss, but Benedict immediately healed him.  The crocodile was dispatched, and the party were left standing on the rotting drawbridge; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 01x01 (12-14-2024):</h3>
      <p>
        Created character: Uri.<br />
        Gave players' background from T1 again for those who had missed it, as well as the adventure introduction.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The party rode into the Village of Hommlet from the south and upon being presented with the village map, decided to go straight to the Inn of the Welcome Wench for brunch.  They were greeted by <b>Ostler Gundigoot</b>, the owner and innkeeper, who served them good food and drink.  He explained that he had fought in the <b>Battle of Emridy Meadows</b> ten years prior, alongside his good friend <b>Jaroo Ashstaff</b>, now the Druid of the Grove in central Hommlet.  Ostler told the party that both Jaroo and <b>Canon Terjon, priest of St. Cuthbert,</b> would be good folk to speak to for a religious training, and the traders' establishment at the base of the hill would be a good source for adventuring equipment.  Ostler then had to see to other patrons.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Church of St. Cuthbert, junior priest <b>Calmert</b> showed concern over the rise in bandit activity.  He explained some of the recent history of the region and expressed fear that he, a young priest with no exposure to war, might soon be thrust into the very center of a resurgence of a decades-old war that may not have ended, just paused for the losing side to lick its wounds.  When the party asked how they could help, Calmert summoned his superior, Canon Terjon.  Terjon explained that the Hommlet council was divided as to the very existence of a resurgence, so he asked the party that any evidence of spies or servants of the old evil should be brought to him or to <b>Rufus</b> and <b>Burne</b> at the new wizard's tower in the east part of town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calmert then asked the party to deliver a written message to <b>Larissa</b>, a serving girl at the Inn of the Welcome Wench.  The message was delivered after the party not-so-discreetly read it and discovered that Calmert is deeply in love with Larissa.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party next went to visit <b>Rannos Davl</b> at the traders' establishment to buy some adventuring gear, but they caused a disturbance and Rannos' partner <b>Gremag</b> showed them the door.  From the outside, the party discovered that in Rannos and Gremag's private quarters was a heavy metal lockbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next door, the local carter's wife explained that her husband and two hired drivers were away on a crucial delivery to the gnomes in the Kron Hills and would be back by morning.  She revealed that she instinctively didn't quite trust the traders, but had no explanation for why.
      </p>
      <p>
        The party continued back into the center of town for a rest, where they heard a rumor that bandits may be congregating in the Moathouse to the east, an old outpost of the Temple of Elemental Evil; end session.
      </p>

      <h3>Session 01x00 (12-07-2024):</h3>
      <p>
        Created characters: Gregor, Rocco, Benedict, Balin, Freddie, and Bill Bill.<br />
        Gave players' background from T1.
